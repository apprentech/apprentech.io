## ApprenTech - Paid High Tech Apprenticeships

So you're interested in pivoting into High Tech? Think you'd fancy being a Full Stack Dev, DevOps Engineer, or Backend Engineer? Look no further!

My partners and I each have a minimum of 10 years of enterprise experience working with companies ranging in size from 2 employees up to and including Fortune 500 companies, and we guarantee we'll get you up to speed quickly, or we'll pay you!

Correct! We'll never take a cent from you either now or later... but we will plug you into the matrix and harvest your grey matter :)


### What Can You Expect?

* Expect to Work/Study like a dog 8-10h a day, Sunday through Thursday
* You'll be involved in live projects, deploying code into production environments
* You'll learn about how to build, optimise, and secure systems and environments (Networks, Servers, Services, Cloud Environments)
* You'll learn about and use/implement virtualisation, containerisation, Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, CI/CD pipelines, security best practices, DRY principles, server and infrastructure automation tools, cost optimisation tools... etc, etc
* Free kosher meals daily
* Free Talmud/Daf Yomi classes during lunch
* Free gym membership
* A (initially: low) salary that increases as your confidence and experience level increases [We want to keep you on our team, after all :)]
* Share options in any of our startups you choose to work with

### Prospects?

In 6-12 months time, you we'll either offer you a full-time salaried position working within one of our startups [With share options, of course!], or you can choose to go out to market and find a better offer, or you can continue working with us until you have sufficient experience to get your dream job. The choice is yours!
