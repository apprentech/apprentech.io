My partners and [I](https://www.linkedin.com/in/garronkramer) each have a minimum of 10 years of enterprise experience working with companies ranging in size from 2 employees up to and including Fortune 500 companies, and we guarantee we'll get you up to speed 'Quick Fast!'

We will never charge you, either directly or indirectly [think: discounted salaries after leaving bootcamp for the first 12 months!], for the training we provide... but we will plug you into the matrix and harvest your grey matter :)

* Get involved in live projects, deploying code into production environments
* Get involved in building, optimising, and securing systems and environments (Networks, Servers, Services, Cloud Environments)
* Learn about and use/implement virtualisation, containerisation, Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, CI/CD pipelines, security best practices, DRY principles, server and infrastructure automation tools, cost optimisation tools... etc, etc
* Start coding from the first week (Python: Its the stuff legends are made of!)
* A salary that increases as your confidence and experience level increases [We want to keep you on our team, after all :)]
* Free kosher meals daily
* Free extra-mural classes [Optional]
* Free gym membership
* Share options in any of our startups which you choose to join



### Prospects?

Within 12 months, we'll either offer you a full-time salaried position working within one of our startups [with share options, of course!] or you can go out to market to find the most exciting offer!
