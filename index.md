## ApprenTech - Paid High Tech Apprenticeships

So you're interested in cross-training into High Tech? Think you'd fancy being a Full Stack Dev, DevOps Engineer, or Backend Engineer? Look no further!

My partners and I each have a minimum of 10 years of enterprise experience working with companies ranging in size from 2 employees up to and including Fortune 500 companies, and we guarantee we'll get you up to speed quickly, or we'll pay you!

Correct! We'll never take a cent from you either now or later... but we will plug you into the matrix and harvest your grey matter :)

### What Can You Expect?

Expect to study and work like a dog for 6-12 months... we'll be there working right alongside you, encouraging you, and helping you to understand the world of IT. We'll involve you in live projects, we'll educate you on 'IT' best practices (security, DRY principles, automation efficiency, cost minimisation, etc), we'll provide meals daily, a gym membership, a salary which increases in line with your experience level [and the level of contribution you make], and we'll give you share options in any startups you choose to contribute to.
